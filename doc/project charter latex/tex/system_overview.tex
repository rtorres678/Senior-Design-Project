The system this project seeks to create is a laser-based instrument. The system will be comprised of several different elements. First, an Arduino or other microcontroller that will be fitted with a number of lasers and photoreceptors. The role of the microcontroller will be to detect breaks or interrupts in the lasers and relay that information to another device. This device will likely be a Raspberry Pi. It will receive the MIDI data and generate tones to correspond with the interrupts of the laser diodes. The Raspberry Pi will have the ability to connect to several different microcontrollers at once and generate sounds based on the incoming signals. Lastly, the device will have several presets that model different kinds of instruments, which users can select on the device itself.
