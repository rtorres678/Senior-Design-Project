Our mission is to design and create a laser-based instrument that produces tonal sounds, while also functioning as a MIDI device for versatility. The ``laser synth'' is going to be portable and based on a Raspberry Pi. The laser diodes emit laser signals which is detected by the system, any interference to it will be detected giving a signal for the audio output. The instrument will be easy to use, so that even children can play the device at ease, while also learning about sounds.
