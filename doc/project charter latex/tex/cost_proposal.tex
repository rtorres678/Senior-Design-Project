Based on previous laser harps that have been built, we have a range of our expected cost range. The cost range, as of September 22, 2019, will at a minimum of \$118.15. Based on previous projects we have analyzed we determined that their cost range is between \$118.55 and \$232.54 USD. 

\subsection{Preliminary Budget}
We listed several expenses below. We expect to not go over our allocated funding of \$800.00 USD. The expenses were broken into components, software licenses, and materials for the frame of the project.
\begin{table}[h]

\caption{Necessary Component Expense}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Arduino Mega                & \$38.50 USD \\
Adafruit Music Maker Shield & \$34.95 USD \\
12V Power Supply            & \$10.00 USD \\
Laser diode                 & \$00.54 USD \\
Breadboard                  & \$05.90 USD 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h]

\caption{Software Licenses}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Blender             & GPL           & \$00.00 USD\\
AutoDesk AutoCAD    & Proprietery   & \$00.00 USD\\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Note: AutoDesk AutoCAD is provided by UTA IOT, thus their is no need to purchase a license.

\caption{Materials for Frame}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Polyactic Acid  & \$00.05  USD \\
Nuts and Screws & \$09.99  USD \\
Wood            & \$17.95  USD
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The pricing for the possible materials we will use has been listed above. This was a estimate with a margin of error. Thus costs could fluctuate above or below the expected budget costs.

\subsection{Current \& Pending Support}
As of September 22, 2019, we only have one source of funding. We do not expect the sources of funding to change. All of our funding for the project will be provided by the CSE department. The maximum amount they can provide to the project is approximately \$800.00 USD.
