Based on previous laser harps that have been built, we have a range of our expected cost range. The cost range, as of September 22, 2019, will at a minimum of \$118.15. Based on previous projects we have analyzed we determined that their cost range is between \$118.55 and \$232.54 USD. 

\subsection{Preliminary Budget}
We listed several expenses below. We expect to not go over our allocated funding of \$800.00 USD. The expenses were broken into components, software licenses, and materials for the frame of the project.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
Raspberry Pi 4              & \$38.40 USD \\
Teensy Microcontroller      & \$37.75 USD \\
Photoresistors              & \$13.95 USD \\
Laser diodes                & \$12.99 USD \\
Perfboards                  & \$09.50 USD \\
10k ohm Resistors           & \$06.28 USD \\
Touch Screen                & \$49.99 USD \\
MDF Panels                  & \$100.00 USD \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\caption{Software Licenses}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Blender             & GPL           & \$00.00 USD\\
AutoDesk AutoCAD    & Proprietery   & \$00.00 USD\\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Note: AutoDesk AutoCAD is provided by UTA IOT, thus their is no need to purchase a license.


The pricing for the possible materials we will use has been listed above. This was a estimate with a margin of error. Thus costs could fluctuate above or below the expected budget costs.

\subsection{Current \& Pending Support}
All of our funding for the project will be provided by the CSE department. The maximum amount they can provide to the project is approximately \$800.00 USD.
