In this last section, you will reiterate all requirements that are listed as priority 5. This is repetitive, but necessary as a concise statement of features/functions that were considered/discussed and documented herein, but will NOT be addressed in the prototype version of the product due to constraints of budget, time, skills, technology, feasibility analysis, etc. Use the following format for this section.
Our future requirements mostly be software enhancements that will improve the experience of the user when using the system. These requirements will be addressed once all other requirements have been met.
