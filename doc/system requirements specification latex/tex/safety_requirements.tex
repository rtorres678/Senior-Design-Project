The laser harp project deals with lasers which can damage the eyes and be hazardous if we are not careful. There are also wires, mister, speakers and power source that is needed to be handled carefully.

\subsection{The lasers on the device should be put in a way they do not point towards anyone’s eyes}
\subsubsection{Description}
The lasers mounted on the product should be fixed and immovable. It should in no way be pointed anywhere else but the receiving sensors. It should not diverge from the path at any angle.

CSE Senior Design laboratory policy
\subsubsection{Constraints}
The laser pointers will be made immovable and fixed to a certain place to minimize risks and will be in compliance with the ANSI Z136 standards.

\subsection{The laser should only point to the receiving sensor.}
\subsubsection{Description}
The lasers should in no way be pointed anywhere else but the receiving sensors. It should be a straight path from the laser pointer to the sensors.

\subsection{The device and all the internal parts should be enclosed.}
\subsubsection{Description}
The internal components i.e. Arduino, speakers, wires, etc. should all be enclosed in a main box/frame so that they are protected from the outside interference.
