This section breaks down your layer abstraction to another level of detail. Here you grapically represent the logical subsytems that compose each layer and show the interactions/interfaces between those subsystems. A subsystem can be thought of as a programming unit that implements one of the major functions of the layer. It, therefore, has data elements that serve as source/sinks for other subsystems. The logical data elements that flow between subsystems need to be explicitly defined at this point, beginning with a data flow-like diagram based on the block diagram.
