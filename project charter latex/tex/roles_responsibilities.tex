The Team members for this project are: Ansih Yonian, Amir Dhunghana, Nik Purohit, Raul Jimenez, Rabinson Shrestha, and Roberto Torres. While there is no current sponsor for the project, we consider Professor McMurrough to be our client. Nik Purohit has taken on the role of being the Product Owner and will be responsible for finalizing the design of the system. As we begin implementation, the Product Owner will also ensure that the finished product meets the success criteria as outlined in the Project Charter. Roberto Torres is the Scrum Master for the project. The responsabilities of the scrum master include coordinating with all the team members and avoiding any scheduling conflicts, assigning the backlog tasks to team members, and generally planning out each sprint. As implementation of the system begins, the team will be divided into a hardware team and a software team. The hardware team will be responsible for the physical laser devices that generate the sounds as lasers are broken. The software team will be in charge of developing the mobile application for configuring the physical devices. The teams will be formed in the future and membership is yet to be determined.
