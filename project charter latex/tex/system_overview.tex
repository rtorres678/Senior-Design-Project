The system this project seeks to create is a laser instrument. The system will be comprised of several different elements. First, an Arduino or other microcontroller device will be outfitted with a number of lasers and photoreceptors. The role of the microcontroller will be to detect breaks or interrupts in the lasers and relay that information to another device. This device will likely be a Raspberry Pi. It will receive the MIDI data and generate tones to correspond with the interrupts of the laser diodes. The Raspberry Pi will have the ability to connect to several different microcontrollers at once and generete sounds based on the incoming signals. The whole device will also be configured through the use of a mobile application that will connect via bluetooth.
