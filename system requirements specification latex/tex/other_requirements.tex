Since the system will be used by kids and is intended to be highly interactive with kids we must take into account the safety and tailor the system to kids. We must have safe product. Additionally, since we are using a microcontroller we must use a programming language that is acceptable and understandable for the microncontroller. We currently do not have plans for modularity or extensibility. Since most microcontroller use C and C++ for their programming we must use C and C++ for the control language of the system.

\subsection{Sharp Edges Mitigation}
\subsubsection{Description}
The physical device should not have any sharp edges that can be hazardous.
\subsubsection{Source}
Development team
\subsubsection{Constraints}
Materials that we use will be sanded down and rounded down to ensure mitigation of hazard
\subsubsection{Standards}
N/A
\subsubsection{Priority}
Moderate

\subsection{Operating System Requirement}
\subsubsection{Description}
The software developed for the microcontroller shall be runnable on unix based system.
\subsubsection{Source}
Development team
\subsubsection{Constraints}
We cannot use microntroller which are not unix based, and don't have digital pins.
\subsubsection{Standards}
Follow coding standards for C++ as noted by the gcc compiler and arduino standards.
\subsubsection{Priority}
High
