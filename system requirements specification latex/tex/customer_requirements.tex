Include a header paragraph specific to your product here. Customer requirements are those required features and functions specified for and by the intended audience for this product. This section establishes, clearly and concisely, the "look and feel" of the product, what each potential end-user should expect the product do and/or not do. Each requirement specified in this section is associated with a specific customer need that will be satisfied. In general Customer Requirements are the directly observable features and functions of the product that will be encountered by its users. Requirements specified in this section are created with, and must not be changed without, specific agreement of the intended customer/user/sponsor.

\subsection{Product shall use visible laser beams}
\subsubsection{Description}
The product shall use laser beams that, when broken/interrupted, will signal the device to produce a tone. An array of laser diodes will be arranged across the top of the device and shine down onto photoresistors that will detect the breaks and relay that information to an onboard microcontroller. The beams shall be made visible through the use of a mister or fogger that allows the laser beam to reflect and appear to shine.
