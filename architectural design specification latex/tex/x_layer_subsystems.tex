In this section, the layer is described in some detail in terms of its specific subsystems. Describe each of the layers and its subsystems in a separate chapter/major subsection of this document. The content of each subsystem description should be similar. Include in this section any special considerations and/or trade-offs considered for the approach you have chosen.

\subsection{Subsystem 1}
This section should be a general description of a particular subsystem for the given layer. For most subsystems, an extract of the architectural block diagram with data flows is useful. This should consist of the subsystem being described and those subsystems with which it communicates.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
Any assumptions made in the definition of the subsystem should be listed and described. Pay particular attention to assumptions concerning interfaces and interactions with other layers.

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
Each of the responsibilities/features/functions/services of the subsystem as identified in the architectural summary must be expanded to more detailed responsibilities. These responsibilities form the basis for the identification of the finer-grained responsibilities of the layer's internal subsystems. Clearly describe what each subsystem does.

\subsubsection{Subsystem Interfaces}
Each of the inputs and outputs for the subsystem are defined here. Create a table with an entry for each labelled interface that connects to this subsystem. For each entry, describe any incoming and outgoing data elements will pass through this interface.

\begin {table}[H]

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | p{1cm} | p{6cm} | p{3cm} | p{3cm} |}
    \hline
    ID & Description & Inputs & Outputs \\ \hline
    \#xx & Description of the interface/bus & \pbox{3cm}{input 1 \\ input 2} & \pbox{3cm}{output 1}  \\ \hline
    \#xx & Description of the interface/bus & \pbox{3cm}{N/A} & \pbox{3cm}{output 1}  \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}
