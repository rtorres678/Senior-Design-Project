The details about the subsystem included in the power layer are discussed below. We are opting to go with traditional 12V 2A DC batteries, assuming that the batteries will be enough to power up the whole system. 

\subsection{Battery}
Battery is the only subsystem component included in this layer. They will act as the power source for all the components. They will be connected to other components via hookup wires and jumper cables.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
The batteries will be able to provide enough power to run all the components of the instrument for a reasonable amount time without difficulties. All the batteries are new and have full capacity.

\subsubsection{Responsibilities}
It is responsible for providiing adequate power to all the components of the device.

\subsubsection{Subsystem Interfaces}
Input and output for the Battery subsystem are mentioned below.
